## **Lab 6: User ID controlled by request parameter, with unpredictable user IDs**

```go
This lab has a horizontal privilege escalation vulnerability on the user account page, but identifies users with GUIDs.

To solve the lab, find the GUID for carlos, then submit his API key as the solution.

You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter 

Steps

1. Access the lab && login
2. By looking at the url we can say every user will get an unique ID
3. Go to Home section and look for excessive information
4. Click on carlos
5. Copy carlos hash id && replace 
6. Submit the API key
7. done
